# LlamaIndex Analysis on Historical Texts

## Project Overview

This project leverages the `llamaindex` tool to analyze and extract insights from the historical book "Thoughts on the Origin and Descent of the Gael: With an Account of the Picts, Caledonians, and Scots; And Observations Relative to the Authenticity of the Poems of Ossian." Our aim is to employ modern text analysis techniques to delve into this seminal work, exploring themes, linguistic patterns, and historical insights.

## Background

The book under analysis offers a comprehensive examination of the Gaelic peoples' origins, alongside discussions on the Picts, Caledonians, Scots, and the famed poems of Ossian. By applying `llamaindex`, we intend to uncover new perspectives and understandings that lie within this rich historical narrative.
